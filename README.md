Key components of the system include:

ESP32: The ESP32 is a powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it ideal for IoT applications. It serves as the central hub for data collection, processing, and communication within the system.

Analog TDS Sensor: TDS stands for Total Dissolved Solids, which measures the concentration of dissolved substances in water. The Analog TDS Sensor is used to measure the TDS levels, which can indicate water quality and potential contamination. It provides accurate and reliable readings for monitoring purposes.

API (Application Programming Interface): The API acts as a bridge between the Water Safety Management System and external platforms, such as databases or mobile applications. It enables seamless data transfer and integration, allowing users to access water quality information from anywhere.

Web App: The system includes a user-friendly web application accessible through web browsers on various devices. The web app provides a comprehensive interface for users to monitor water quality parameters, view historical data, set alerts, and configure system parameters. It also allows users to receive real-time notifications and access detailed reports.

How the system works:

Data Collection: The Analog TDS Sensor is connected to the ESP32, which continuously collects water quality data by measuring the TDS levels. The ESP32 processes and analyzes the data to determine the water's safety.

Data Transmission: The ESP32 securely sends the collected data to the API using the internet connectivity provided by the ESP32's Wi-Fi module. The API acts as a gateway for storing and processing the data in a central database.

Data Integration: The API integrates the collected data with other systems or applications, allowing users to access water quality information through different platforms. This integration enables data visualization, analysis, and customized reporting.

Monitoring and Alerting: The web app provides a real-time monitoring interface that displays the current water quality parameters. Users can set specific thresholds or conditions, and the system will trigger alerts if any parameters exceed the predefined limits. Alerts can be sent via email, SMS, or push notifications to ensure timely response.

Historical Analysis and Reporting: The web app allows users to view historical water quality data, generate reports, and analyze trends over time. This feature helps identify patterns, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions regarding water safety measures.

The Water Safety Management System with ESP32, Analog TDS Sensor, API, and Web App is a comprehensive solution that ensures the safety of water in residential, institutional, and public applications. By leveraging IoT technology and real-time monitoring, this system enables proactive measures to maintain water quality standards and safeguard public health.
